# PCO API OAuth Example

This is an example Sinatra app for demonstrating how one might build an app to authenticate any PCO user
and then subsequently use that authentication to query the API using [pco_api](https://github.com/planningcenter/pco_api_ruby).

```
bundle install
ruby app.rb
```

Now visit [localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567).
